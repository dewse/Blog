A blog for myself that relates to everything in my repo and beyond.

## Intro

Back in the early 00s, when I just turned into a teen, I was exposed to Angelfire and the wonders of making sites. Although my grasp of HTML was extremely basic, I enjoyed what could be done with it. At the library, I took out a book on DHTML but quickly became lost. The further I went into the next chapter, the less I felt like I understood the many terms I was unfamiliar with, so my attention and motivation were shifted back towards art and sciences.

Fast forward a decade and a half and my interest for coding was reborn when I realized that coding was a crossroad and a great potential for a great amount of my interests. At this point, I came to the understanding that I needed to figure out what profession I finally wanted to do for the rest of my life, and I've never felt such clarity about it.

Knowing that if I wanted to work in the gaming industry at some point that I would likely have to learn a language like C/C++. After a bit of this, I noticed that I spent more time fixing simple issues than making stuff and that I was at a great disadvantage without formal education on computer theory, so I decided to also learn a more beginner-friendly language, so I picked up Python. I also tried to learn a bit of other languages such as SQL, JavaScript, and Excel/Googlesheet -- open to many more. I've always loved languages. French is my native language, and I've learned enough Russian and Spanish to get by. This love for language might has also spawned my interest for coding again.

Now half a year later, I'm still coding and slowly learning as much as I can when I have free time. I've never had this level of satisfaction as I do when I finally make a code work as I want it to. I hope to be good enough to make webapps and perhaps indie games, but I take it a day at a time.
