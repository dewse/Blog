# Blog
A blog for myself that relates to everything in my repo and beyond.

## Intro
Back in the early 00s, when I waa 12, I was exposed to Angelfire and the wonders if creating sites.
Although my grasp of HTML was very basic, I enjoyed what could be done with it. At the library I took out
a book on DHTML but quickly became lost past the beginning with concepts I was clueless about and lost interest
for art and science.

Fast forward a decade and a half and my interest for coding was reborn when I realized that coding
was a crossroad between all my other interests. Knowing that if I wanted to work in the gaming industry that
I would likely have to learn a language like C/C++. After a bit of this, I noticed that I spent more time
fixing simple issues than making stuff, so I decided to also learn a more beginner friendly language, so
I picked up Python. I also tried to learn a bit of other languages such as SQL, JavaScript, and Excel/Googlesheet.

Now half a year later, I'm still coming and slowly learning it all when I have free time. I've never had this
feeling of satisfaction as I do when I finally make a code work as I want it. I hope to be good enough to make
webapps and perhaps indie games, but I take it a day at a time.
